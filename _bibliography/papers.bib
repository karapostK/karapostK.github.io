  abstract = {We introduce Emotion-aware Music Tower Blocks (EmoMTB), an audiovisual interface to explore large music collections. It creates a musical landscape, by adopting the metaphor of a city, where similar songs are grouped into the same building and nearby buildings form neighborhoods of particular genres. In order to personalize the user experience, an underlying classifier monitors textual user-generated content, by predicting their emotional state and adapting the audiovisual elements of the interface accordingly. EmoMTB enables users to explore different musical styles either within their comfort zone or outside of it. Besides, tailoring the results of the recommender engine to match the affective state of the user, EmoMTB offers a unique way to discover and enjoy music. 
EmoMTB supports exploring a collection of circa half a million streamed songs using a regular smartphone as a control interface to navigate in the landscape.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
