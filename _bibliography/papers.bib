  abstract={Although current music recommender systems suggest new tracks to their users, they do not provide listenable explanations of why a user should listen to them. LEMONS (Demonstration video: https://youtu.be/giSPrPnZ7mc) is a new system that addresses this gap by (1) adopting a deep learning approach to generate audio content-based recommendations from the audio tracks and (2) providing listenable explanations based on the time-source segmentation of the recommended tracks using the recently proposed audioLIME}

abstract = { Recommender systems, like other tools that make use of machine learning, are known to create or increase certain biases. Earlier work has already unveiled different performance of recommender systems for different user groups, depending on gender, age, country, and consumption behavior. In this work, we study user bias in terms of another aspect, i.e., users’ personality. We investigate to which extent state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms yield different accuracy scores depending on the users’ personality traits. We focus on the music domain and create a dataset of Twitter users’ music consumption behavior and personality traits, measuring the latter in terms of the OCEAN model. Investigating recall@K and NDCG@K of the recommendation algorithms SLIM, embarrassingly shallow autoencoders for sparse data (EASE), and variational autoencoders for collaborative filtering (Mult-VAE) on this dataset, we find several significant differences in performance between user groups scoring high vs. groups scoring low on several personality traits.},

abstract = {Past studies have shown that personality has a significant association with user behaviour and preferences, not least towards music. This makes personality information a promising aspect for user modelling in personalised recommender systems and similar domains. In contrast to existing studies, which investigate personality correlates of music preferences via genres or styles, we study such correlates by modelling music preferences at a finer-grained content level, using audio features of the music users listen to. Leveraging listening and personality information of more than 1,300 Last.fm users, we identify several significant medium and weak correlations between music audio features and personality traits, the latter defined by the five-factor model. Our results provide useful insights into the relationship between personality and music preference, which can be valuable for music recommender systems in terms of more personalised recommendations.},
