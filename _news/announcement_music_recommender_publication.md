The article "[Explainability in Music Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10528)" will appear in the the Summer 2022 Issue of the [Ai Magazine](https://www.aaai.org/Magazine/magazine.php). The article is the result of a very enjoyable and productive collaboration with my supervisor Markus Schedl and Darius Afchar, Romain Hennequin, Elena V. Epuree, and Manuel Moussallam from Deezer Research.
