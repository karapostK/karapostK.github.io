I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href='https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/'>Institute of Computational Perception</a> at the <a href='https://www.jku.at/en'>Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>, Austria. 

I am enthusiastic about developing interpretable models and explainability methods for recommender systems, especially in the music domain. I am also interested in bias and fairness of recommender system algorithms and investigating the relationships between users' characteristics and music preference and consumption.
