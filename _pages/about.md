Hola!

I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute <a href='https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/'> of Computational Perception</a> and at Multimedia Mining and Search Group at the <a href='https://www.jku.at/en'>Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>, Austria. 

I studied Engineering in Computer Science in my Bachelor at <a href='https://www.unina.it'>Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II</a> and in my Master at <a href='https://www.uniroma1.it'>Sapienza - Università di Roma</a> where I both graduated with full marks. 

My main interests revolve around the topics of **recommender system algorithms**, **explainability in AI**, and **bias & fairness**. I am particularly enthusiastic about developing interpretable models and explainability methods for recommender systems, especially in the music domain. I am also interested in investigating the relationships between users' characteristics and music preference and consumption.
