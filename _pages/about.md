I am a PhD student in Machine Learning and Computer Science at the <a href='https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/'> Institute of Computational Perception</a> at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria.

My research specializes in recommender system algorithms, explainable AI, and fairness in machine learning. My work has been published in esteemed conferences and journals such as RecSys, ECML-PKDD, ECIR, AI Magazine, and Information Processing & Management.

Additionally, I led two science communication projects showcased at the international <a href='https://karapostK.github.io/projects'> Ars Electronica Festival </a> in Linz, Austria. 

I hold both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Engineering in Computer Science.
